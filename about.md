I started my career in telecom embedded field. I have written software for both voice and data communication. I was thrilled, the first time, when the code I had written was put in the network and people started making calls using my software. I have also written software for TCP/IP applications, APIs, device driver software. In addition to development, I have done system integration, test, automation and sustain engineering jobs.

After playing all the software roles in telecom field, I felt I need to get into a field which continues to make me feel creative and passionate about my job and also gives opportunity to learn new technologies. That is when I decided to get into web technologies. I took training in this to be able to do what I want to do. I am excited for having made my portfolio public. Though it might seem like a small thing, for me it is a milestone. After I started doing projects in this area, I felt the need to know Data analytics, So I got a certification in Data base and Data Analytics. 

Now I have already been in this web technology for more than 3 years doing Ruby on Rails projects along with front end technologies. I love what I am doing now. 
Web technologies is vast, there is lot to learn. I like to try out new stuff.

When I am not doing that, I like teaching kids. I read books. The rest of the time, my family takes away my time. I love to take long walks. Otherwise, I spend time in web browsing and reading magazines and exercising.
